# DiningDetective
Dining Detective is an app that uses a neural network to predict when the dining halls at Georgia Tech will be busy and whether or not they are low on food. Watch a demo of our app **[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUZwAceeBcs&ab_channel=MashinaR)**.

# Inspiration 
We were inspired by waiting in line at the Brittain dining hall for over **30 minutes** while trying to get lunch last week, and when we finally got to the front there was little food left, and we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for fresh food to be brought out.

# What it does 
The app utilizes a neural network and predicts what times the dining halls are the busiest and how low on food they are. We hope to provide students with a reliable way to avoid the busiest times and long waits.

# How we built it 
We used Android Studio and Java to build the framework of the app and python to write the machine learning required to build the neural network.

# Challenges we ran into
One of our challenges was communicating between Java for the front end and python for the back end. We also had a tough time figuring how to manage the input and output of data.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our successful implementation of a neural network based off of over 10,000 distinct data points instead of a basic linear regression model along with efficiently storing user data through the use of CSV files. And while not as technical, our visual design is also something we are quite proud of.

# How to Install
